# Delta Lima
Delta Lima is the phonetic pronunciation of "D L", standing for <ins>D</ins>ata<ins>L</ins>ink.  

### What is Delta Lima?  
Delta Lima is a project aimed at creating a free to use, open source application to rival messaging services like SnapChat, Discord, Whatsapp, and many more
without spying on users or logging anything.

### How is my data protected?
Messages are encrypted with `insert algorithm name here` before they are event sent to the server, meaning the only ones who can read these messages are the
clients involved. IPs used to connect and other connection information will never be logged on the server, only stored in ram during the duration of the
connection. Login information will only include a username and password, and an email address may later be added to add a way to reset your password.
